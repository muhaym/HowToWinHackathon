# How to win Mobile App hackathons?

Dos:

 * Use Xamarin.Forms
 * Incorporate Maximum Plugins and Existing Libraries to do heavy lifting
 * Keep these libraries in mind
 * Start Simple and add features one by one. Make sure you have MVP (Minimum Viable Product) ready for presentation.
 * Use version controlling like git to revert back when you mess things up :D
 
 	 [System.Net.Http](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http/) for consuming API services  
 	[NewtonSoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) for serializing and deserializing data to and from JSON (Javascript Object Notation)  
 	[Xamarin Plugins Ecosystem](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Xamarin.Plugins) for pretty much every tasks like Media Picker, Connectivity, Maps, and much more which otherwise will take you a lot of time) 
 	
    For this sample I will be using [Media Plugin](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/MediaPlugin) which helps to select photos from gallery or camera.

Dont's or Warnings
* Don't go overboard in implementing unwanted logics like Login - Registeration flows, Keep it simple.
* Focus on having a decent UI with simple flow, your coding and logic counts, but everything will be based on how smooth the flow and UI is during presentation.
